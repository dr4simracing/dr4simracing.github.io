Overlay for Assetto Corsa Competizione (ACC) built for qualifying sessions and fast pit adjustments.  
After a clean run, the app calculates the clicks per wheel needed to reach the target PSI, shows tire and brake temperatures, and estimates the required fuel based on race duration.

What it does

GOAL: TIRE PRESSURE ADJUSTMENT (PSI)
The main goal is to reach optimal tire pressure under race conditions. Complete at least 2 clean laps (ideally 4 laps) for consistent data.  
The app provides precise PSI adjustments (**setup clicks**) per wheel based on track temperature—maximizing grip and tire performance.

Features

-Real-time tires 
  Real-time tire temperature display to understand grip and wear.  
  Intuitive color system:
  - Green: optimal condition  
  - Red: critical condition (low performance or overheating)

-Brakes min / max  
  Logs min and max brake temperatures to help adjust brake ducts and prevent overheating (long stints).

-Fuel calculation  
  Enter race duration and the app estimates required fuel to avoid extra weight.

-Clear per-wheel readout  
  Data split by wheel (**FL / FR / RL / RR**) for quick pit decisions.

-Qualifying workflow  
  Optimized flow: go out → complete laps → return to pits → adjust setup.

How it works (steps)

-Step 1: Time (fuel)  
Enter race duration so the app can calculate required fuel—avoiding unnecessary weight.

-Step 2: Do a clean run  
Complete at least  2 clean laps (ideally 4) to gather consistent pressure/temperature data.

-Step 3: Adjust PSI per wheel  
Check recommended  clicks per wheel  in your setup to reach target PSI.

-Step 4: Optimize brakes  
Use min/max brake temperatures to adjust brake duct cooling and prevent overheating.

Note: The project website is prepared for more simulators, but this repository is focused on ACC.

Requirements
- Windows (recommended)
- Assetto Corsa Competizione
- ACC telemetry/UDP enabled (depending on your settings)
